The spokesman for the federal electricity commission denied that 1 or more dams planned for the Usumacinta River, which marks the border between Mexico and Guatemala, would produce such effects. The choice of a site has not been made for the dam whose construction should begin in 1994. While the Mexican government downplays its ambitions, it continues to suggest that it might expand the project later, possibly under an accord with Guatemala. Mexican energy officals disclosed new dam project two weeks after these comments. The countries began studies for a huge joint dam project on the Usumacinta river in 1980, but public protests, technical considerations and strife along the border delayed the plans. In May 1989, the Salina administration announced that the program had been cancelled because of Guatemala's concerns that it would destroy precious archeological sites. Yet one of the results of Salina's feb. 24 trip to Guatemala city was a new agreement under which Mexico will sell guatemala electricity.  ",,

As people continue to cut forests, rich soil that should sustain Nepal crops is ending up downstream, in rivers of India, subjecting millions of Indians every year to floods as dirt-clogged rivers overflow more easily and frequently. A United States official said tapping hydropower would bring ""quantum jump"" in Nepal's development, providing water and power for year-round irrigation. Nepal plans to construct 3 small hydropower plants in various parts of 3 major river basins--Karnali, Gandaki and Kosi. A big advantage of such projects is selling power to India. Project feasiblity will be studied by the World Bank, but India's assistance is being sought since they'll receive benefits.

Mexico accuses the US of violating longstanding treaties, but American officals say they intend to move ahead with the project. One of Mexico's most productive agricultural areas is in question, as well as water supplies to Tijuana & Mexicali. L.A. & San Diego would be deprived of a water source if Mexico's position prevails. The issue has been referred to the International Boundary & Water Commission. Controversy is the result of an American proposal to reline the All-American Canal, which carries water from the Colorado River into California Imperial Valley, where it is used largely for irrigation. Currently, half the volume in the canal is lost to seepage, which flows underground across the border. Last November, the US Congress authorized the Department of Interior to reline a 66-mile stretch of the canal west of Andrade, California. Mexican officials claim the project violates a 1973 agreement on Colorado River water signed by the 2 governments. Mexican officials say they intend to protest in every possible manner. American officials have rejected Mexican complaints outright, saying that water diverted through the canal was part of the 1944 agreement. Settlement of the dispute is further complicated by the fact that the 1944 treaty does not address groundwater.

A spokesman for the Federal Electricity Commission denied that the 1 or more dams it now plans to build on the Usumacinta River, which marks an isolated stretch of border between Mexico & Guatamala, would produce such effects. A choice among 3 site options has not been made for the dam whose construction should begin in 1994. Only a series of dams would be economically viable on the river. While the Mexican government downplays its ambitions, it continues to suggest that it might expand the project later, possibly under an accord with Guatamala. The project has received criticisms. Mexican energy officals disclosed the new dam project 2 weeks later. The two countries began studies for a huge joint dam project on the Usumacinta in 1980, but public protests, technical considerations & strife along the border altered & delayed plans. In May 1989, the Salina Administration announced that a program had been canceled because of Guatemalan concerns that it would destroy precious archeological sites. Yet one of the results of Salina's February 24 trip to Guatamala City was a new agreement under which Mexico will sell Guatamala electricity & while Mexican officials emphasize that the 1st new dam will be exclusively on Mexican soil & for Mexican consumption, they do not rule out a joint project later on.",,

The agreement, reached as a high-ranking Tajik delegation visited Kabul, marks the first exchange of missions between Afghanistan's new Islamic government and any of the former Soviet central Asian republics.  Afghan rebel forces captured the capital on April 25 in the climax to 14 years of civil war against a Soviet-backed communist government. Tajikistan borders Afghanistan to the north and the two have important economic and cultural ties.  About 30 per cent of Afghans are ethnic Tajiks, including the current president, prime minister and defence minister.  The Tajik delegation, which included Prime Minister Akbar Mirzoyev, arrived in Kabul on Tuesday and met Afghan President Burhannudin Rabbani at a state dinner that evening.  In addition to agreeing on an exchange of missions, the two governments discussed the supply of Tajik electricity to Afghanistan and the export of Afghan natural gas to Tajikistan.  ''Tajikistan supplies electricity to parts of northern Afghanistan and we are looking to expand that service,'' Jalil Shams, the Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister, told reporters on Wednesday. ''We also discussed the joint exploitation of our countries' hydroelectric resources,'' he added.  The Tajik delegation left Kabul by air en route to Dushanbe on Wednesday afternoon.  Afghan foreign ministry sources said the diplomatic exchange with Tajikistan would be at the charge level because the new Islamic government in Kabul has not yet appointed ambassadors to any countries.",,

Three years ago when the late Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister, India virtually closed its border with landlocked Nepal, allowing only a trickle of goods from third countries to pass through border check points.A Nepal Foreign ministry official, who did not want to be named, said Rao's visit was meant to reassure Nepal that India's governing Congress party wants good relations with the Himalayan kingdom, despite what happened under Gandhi.The balance of trade is decidedly in India's favour. About 85 per cent of Nepal's total trade with India was imports.  The 15-month trade feud that began in 1989 was over Nepal's attempts to diversify its trade away from India.

Clean drinking water is in short supply. Hospitals perform only emergency operations and can no longer properly store blood supplies and medicines requiring constant refrigeration.  ''All basic services here are electrically driven and people have never had to consider how to provide things like water and heating without electricity,'' said McLean. Aid workers say many essential medical supplies are lacking due to restrictions associated with the three-year-old U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  Ghazi Abdullah Fandi, director of the city's main Azadi Hospital, said hospitals were short of everything from syringes to solutions to treat kidney failure in children, an increasing problem because of impure water. ''Since 1991, we have been living off old supplies and the materials we get from aid agencies. Now our stores are depleted and we don't get enough from aid agencies,'' said Fandi.  Generators cannot meet the shortfall in power, forcing some people to rely on murky streams for drinking water.  Statistics from the Azadi Hospital show what aid workers and doctors called an alarming increase in certain illnesses. Typhoid cases in Dahuk city rose to 188 in September, from 41 in the same month last year. Diarrhoea cases just about doubled to more than 900 in September. In August there were 26 cases of hepatitis, more than twice the number in August 1992.",,

The issue was raised during a meeting of SADC Council Ministers, which ended in Johannesburg, South Africa over the weekend. Mozambique concerns are not reflected in documents emerging from the meeting, which states merely that management of the region's rivers will be subject for later negotiations. The document urged Mozambique to sign the SADC protocol on water resources, despite its reservations.

The sides agree on Palestine's future water needs in the West Bank (70-80 million cubic meters). Palestine will receive additional water during interim period, partly from inside Israel, & Israel will drill a well to supply Janin & Gaza Strip with more water. A joint water committee will be established, the agenda of which will be decided jointly. The committee will permit drilling & new water uses.

When Ola was asked whether it was true that the West Bengal government was withdrawing water downstream of Farakka by a water pump in violation of the treaty, he evaded the question.
